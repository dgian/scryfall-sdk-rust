This is a basic SDK for the amazing https://scryfall.com[Scryfall search-engine] written in https://www.rust-lang.org[Rust].Scryfall is a powerful search tool for Magic: The Gathering cards, sets etc.

This SDK is implemented mainly for learning and practicing Rust skills.

IMPORTANT: This is currently a WIP.

== Usage

First add the dependency to `Cargo.toml`. Currently this crate is not published on https://crates.io[crates.io], so use this git repository instead.

[source, toml]
----
[dependencies]
scryfall_sdk_rust = {git = "https://github.com/dgian/scryfall-sdk-rust.git"}
----

The SDK exposes two HTTP clients using https://crates.io/crates/reqwest[reqwest crate]:

[loweralpha]
. async client (default) via `Scryfall` struct
. blocking client via `ScryfallBlocking` struct

NOTE: In order to use the blocking client you have to enable the `blocking` optional feature in Cargo.toml.

=== Examples

In order to use the SDK, you have to take an instance of either client
and make a request with it using one of the <<_resources, provided resources>>.

For example:

.Get a single card by Scryfall id (async)
[source, rust]
----
use std::error::Error;
use scryfall_sdk_rust::{CardResource, Scryfall};

#[tokio::main] // <1>
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
    let scryfall = Scryfall::default(); // <2>

    let card = scryfall.request(
        &CardResource::ById("f295b713-1d6a-43fd-910d-fb35414bf58a")
    ).await?; // <3>

    Ok(println!("{:?}", card))
}
----
<1> Using https://crates.io/crates/tokio[tokio runtime] for the examples, but you can use anyone you like
<2> https://api.scryfall.com[Default scryfall api].You can also instantiate the client using `::from_url(&str)` to pass a custom url.
<3> Make an async request to retrieve the card's data
